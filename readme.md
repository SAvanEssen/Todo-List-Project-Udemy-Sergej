I am creating a To-do List with the help of the Udemy Course by Colt Steele. 
I have been adding some HTML and been playing around with css options.
Allready created a container where I want deleted items to go to after deleting from the To-Do List.
That second list I want two options in, the slider has a recycle icon and I want it to have the function
of returning a deleted item back to the To-Do List.
The eraser Icon should either remove remaining items in the list alltogether or move them to a database,
yet to decide on that. Benefit would be you can allways retreive information about all you have done in a period of time.
